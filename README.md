# Sorting and Searching Algorithm Visual Demonstration

Sorting Algorithms - Within the program, I have made 6 sorting algorithms, each visually demonstrating how it works in both ascending and descending manner.
  a. Insertion Sort
  b. Selection Sort
  c. Bubble Sort
  d. Merge Sort
  e. Shell Sort
  f. Quick Sort

Searching Algorithm - We have decided to only demonstrate 2 searching algorithms with their own visual demonstration since these searching algorithms are often used in programming. 
  a. Linear Search
  b. Binary Search - Within Binary search, there's a 3 sorting algorithms a user must choose, since in order to search binary, an array must be sorted.
    i. Insertion sort
    ii. Selection sort
    iii. Bubble sort

Note: this C project is a group project for our activity but given the fact that I did most of the work, I might as well compile it on my growing portfolio
